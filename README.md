# COVID-19 Survey, Republic of Korea, 2022

This repository provides information about a survey conducted in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and code that supports the findings of studies using the data. The public's trust in public health institutions and compliance with health guidelines, such as vaccination and mask-wearing, have been regarded as essential to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an unprecedented health emergency in the contemporary era. However, recently, in Korean society, mistrust towards the government and health authorities, their response policies, and vaccines has been increasingly rising. To design effective infectious disease prevention and response policies, it is vital to understand the socio-psychological drivers of people's health behaviors and confidence in vaccines and preventive policies. With the support of the [Academy of Korean Studies](http://intl.aks.ac.kr/english/index.do), this project conducted a nationwide online survey four times (1,500 per round) to investigate Korean adults' COVID-19 preventive behaviors, perceptions of vaccines, government trust, and socio-demographic information.
